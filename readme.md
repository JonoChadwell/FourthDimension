Mouse + WASD + <LeftShift> + <Space> - Spatial navigation of 3d camera.

1 - reverse gravity
2 - spawn ball
3 - toggle "slice" mode
4 - Display 4th dimension as shading
5 - Project 4th dimension spatially
6 - Toggle bounding hypercube vs "top" and "bottom" bounding cubes
7 - Change hypersphere render quality
8 - Reduce physics dimensions
9 - Increase physics dimensions
0 - Toggle spawned ball size (big vs small)

X - Clear all balls
Z - Toggle "gravity follows visual down"
C - Reset gravity
P - pause physics simulation
'/' - Reset 4d camera rotation

The remaining controls all adjust a slider value. The first listed key is "increase", the second "decrease", and the third "reset".

R, F, V - adjust slice offset (slice mode only)
T, G, B - Adjust 4d camera rotation 1
Y, H, N - Adjust 4d camera rotation 2
U, J, M - Adjust 4d camera rotation 3
